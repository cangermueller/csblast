COMPILATION
-----------
The src subdirecory contains the source files and two makefiles (Makefile and
Makefile.csalign) that are needed to compile the cs-executables. To start the
compilation, simply change into the src directory and execute any of the
following commands:

make csblast
make csbuild
make csclust
make cssgd
make cstrainset
make cstranslate
make -f Makefile.csalign csalign

After the compilation has finished, the newly created executables can be found
in the bin subdirectory.

CONTEXT LIBRARIES
-----------------
The data subdirectory contains the library of 4000 context profiles needed by
CS-BLAST, as well as the CS62 column state alphabet for translating sequence
profiles into CS62 sequences with cstranslate.
- data/K4000.lib: context library of the generative model
- data/K4000.crf: context library of the discriminative model
