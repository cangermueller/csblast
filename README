COMPILATION
-----------

The src subdirecty contains the source files and two makefiles (Makefile and
Makefile.csalign) that are needed to compile the cs-executables. To start the
compilation, simply change into the src directory and execute any of the
following commands:

make csblast NDEBUG=1
make csbuild NDEBUG=1
make csclust NDEBUG=1 OPENMP=1
make cstrainset NDEBUG=1 OPENMP=1
make cstranslate NDEBUG=1
make -f Makefile.csalign csalign

After the compilation has finished, the newly created executables can be found
in the src subdirectory (not the bin directory!). The bin directory contains
precompiled executables of all cs-executables from above.


CONTEXT LIBRARIES
-----------------

The data subdirectory contains the library of 4000 context profiles needed by
CS-BLAST, as well as the CS62 column state alphabet for translating sequence
profiles into CS62 sequences with cstranslate.


If you have any problems or questions regarding the suite of cs-tools please
