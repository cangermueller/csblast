== CS-BLAST 2.2.0 (January 20th, 2012)
* Encompasses all changes since February 19th, 2010.
* CRFs allow for better results than the context library now.
* New parameter -z <neff> to define the number of effective sequences
  in the PSSM created by CS-BLAST. Unlike using a constant value for 
  the admixture parameter alpha which can be set by -x, alpha is optimized
  dynamically to adjust the number of effective sequences in the predicted
  profile.
* New parameter --shift <bits> which can be used to adjust profile scores.
* Exceptions are printed to stderr instead of stdout now.

== CS-BLAST 2.1.2 (February 19th, 2010)
* Fixed bug concerning left-over tempfiles in /tmp directory when running CS-BLAST.
* Minor changes in format of K4000.lib context library.

== CS-BLAST 2.1.1 (August 21th, 2009)
* You can run CS-BLAST in batch mode by putting several query sequences into the
  input file. CS-BLAST will automatically recognizes the sequences and process
  all of them sequentially. This batch mode currently works for CS-BLAST only,
  not for CSI-BLAST)
* Added new csprobs binary. It takes a sequence or alignment as input and
  prints the posterior probabilities for each context profile along the query
  sequence.

== CS-BLAST 2.1.0 (August 11th, 2009)
* Reported E-values in CS-BLAST are now correct when compared to BLAST. E-values
  are no longer too optimistic by a factor of about three.
* CS-BLAST now uses the parameters derived from parameter optimization on the
  optimization set instead of the benchmark set (weight_center=1.6,
  weight_decay=0.85 and tau 0.9). Because of this the profile library K4000.lib
  (not its format) has also changed.
* Added executables compiled with Intel's icc instead of g++. We found that icc
  produces very fast code that runs about 10% to 15% faster than the standard
  executables compiled with g++.

== CS-BLAST 2.0.3 (June 19th, 2009)

* Fixed a bug that prevented setting the number of one-line descriptions
  and alignments in CSI-BLAST.
* Fixed a bug that occurred when searching against multiple databaes with
  CS(I)-BLAST.

== CS-BLAST 2.0.2 (June 16th, 2009)

* Fixed a bug that occured if csblast or csbuild were run with a sequence
  containind the amino acid letter 'X'.

== CS-BLAST 2.0.1 (May 28th, 2009)

* Added section about usage of CSI-BLAST to README.
* Fixed bug that prevented alignment format other than '-m 0' in CS-BLAST
  NOTE: CSI-BLAST output format is fixed to '-m 0' because CSI-BLAST because CSI-
  BLAST needs to parse PSI-BLAST output in order to extract an alignment of hits)

== CS-BLAST 2.0.0 (May 13th, 2009)

* Changed format of profile library (new format is as in K4000.lib)
* Fixed bug that prevented saving of checkpoint files in CSI-BLAST
* Fixed bug that prevented inclusion of more than 250 hits in PSSM in CSI-BLAST
* Fixed bug concerning lower case letters in PSI formatted input alignment for
  -R option
