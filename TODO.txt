Definitely:
* User-friendly error messages for GetOpt-Exceptions.
* ProgressBar class for use in cstrain and csclust.
* Make BaumWelch and Clustering take pointer to Params instead of reference.
* Add return value to BW::run and Clustering::run (1: converged, 0: not converged)
* Make HMM/ProfileLib arguments to EM methods pointers instead of refs

Nice-to-have:
* Rename 'from' and 'to' members in Transition to 'source' and 'target'
